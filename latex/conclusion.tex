\section{Conclusion}
It has been (accidentaly) demonstrated that too tight controller loop can prevent steering of intert plants into sustained oscillations.
Realizing the overshoot is roughly proportional to the control loop duration, suitable sustained oscillation modes can be invoked.
\par
Another practical problem encountered were the local extrema along the plant output, regardless of the plant's intertia.
A proposed solution is designing a more sophisiticated, noncasual digital filter.

The following experimental points were reported by the device during recording of graph 3.7.1:
\\
\rowcolors{1}{white}{lightgray}
\begin{tabular}{p{3cm} | p{3cm} | p{3cm}}
extr. type & deci & seconds  \\
min        & 287  & 428      \\
max        & 452  & 569      \\
min        & 271  & 711      \\
max        & 449  & 859
\end{tabular}
\\
Those fit well the graph and specification, most within 10\% relative error.
\par
With the ever accelerating technological growth, RospberryPi products are overwhelming the low-price segment.
AVR, PIC, MSP and other families of microcontrollers are still essential for low-power applications or mission-critical hardware.
