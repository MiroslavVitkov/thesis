\subsection{Goals}
The priorities during hardware design have been the following, in order of importance:
\begin{itemize}
\item{safety - the device shall not cause a fire or electric shock to the end user}
\item{reconstructability - the device shall be composed \textbf{only} of worldwide accessible components}
\item{price - the BOM for the complete device shall not exceed 100BGN}
\item{ease of assembly - it shall be possible for a person with zero hardware experience to manufacture the device}
\item{minimalism - each component shall fufill a specific purpose, and the number of components shall be the lowest possible}
\end{itemize}
