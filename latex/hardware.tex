\section{Hardware}
\subsection{Goals}
The device is intended as a learning project for the student, but also as a open software, open-hardwre project, which anyone can create and use.
Thus, the following hardware design priorities have been identified, in order of decreasing importance:
% TODO: create a custom environment, which bolds the word before the dash
\begin{itemize}
\item{safety - the device shall not cause a fire or electric shock to the end user}
\item{reconstructability - the device shall be composed \textbf{only} of worldwide accessible components}
\item{longivity - the device shall remain operational for 5 years of uninterrupted service with 95\% confidence}
\item{price - the BOM for the complete device shall not exceed 100BGN}
\item{extendability - the number of input sensors and the number of output controllers, shall be trivially configurable}
\item{ease of assembly - it shall be possible for a person with zero hardware experience to manufacture the device}
\item{minimalism - each component shall fufill a specific purpose, and the number of components shall be the lowest possible}
\end{itemize}
